Each skill teaches your agent how to work with a specific app: its structure, actions, and when to use what. Built on [Membrane](https://getmembrane.com) and the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) specification.

## What’s in this repo?

- **3,000+ app-specific skills** — One skill per app (e.g. `gmail`, `slack`, `hubspot`, `salesforce`). Each skill describes the app’s concepts, available actions, and how to use the Membrane CLI.
- **Works with your agent** — Drop-in support for [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/skills), Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, and any agent that supports the Agent Skills spec. Use with OpenClaw’s ClawHub or install via `npx skills add`.
- **Auth handled for you** — OAuth, API keys, token refresh: Membrane manages credentials so your agent doesn’t have to.

## What your agent can do

Once a skill for an App is installed, your agent can connect to that app and run actions on your behalf — no API keys in the prompt, no copy-pasting docs.

| You say | Agent does |
|--------|------------|
| *"Send a message to #general on Slack: deploy is done"* | Uses the Slack skill, finds the right action, runs it with the right params. |
| *"Create a Jira ticket for the login bug, assign to me, high priority"* | Uses the Jira skill, creates the issue, sets assignee and priority. |
| *"Add a new row to our Google Sheet with today’s metrics"* | Uses the Google Sheets skill, finds the connection, runs the action. |
| *"List my last 10 emails from Gmail"* | Uses the Gmail skill, lists messages. |

Each skill includes the app’s **structure** (entities and resources), **available actions**, and **when to use which action** when it’s not obvious.

## Skill layout

  ...         (3,000+ more)
